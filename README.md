# lastmanstanding
A gamemode for Garrysmod using the fluffy minigames base

**REQUIRES:**
https://github.com/fluffy-servers/minigames_v2

**HOW TO INSTALL**
Put the folder "fluffy_lastmanstanding" in with the rest of the fluffy_minigames gamemodes.

I have also included the required map - lms_the_pit_b2.bsp. Put this in your servers maps folder, and ensure your server can send it to the players.


**HOW TO PLAY**

Players start each round on podiums, a countdown timer runs, and players are given the same random weapon. Shoot first, think later and be the last person standing on the podium to win.
